## ♾️ The Infinite Horizon Protocol

### 1. State Persistence
- [ ] This PR builds upon the established architecture without breaking context.
- [ ] I have updated the `ROADMAP.md` to reflect where this code goes next.

### 2. Mandatory Up-Level
*Per protocol, identify one specific technical escalation for the next iteration:*
> **Technical Recommendation:** [Insert specific tech stack upgrade, refactor target, or performance optimization here]

### 3. Anti-Pattern Check
- [ ] No "temporary fixes" (If temporary, mark with `// TODO: Refactor in vX.X`).
- [ ] No closure phrases in code comments.

*Code is a living organism. Deployment is just a state change.*
